# command ideas / things to fix:
# delete my last message because APPARENTLY NORMAL USERS CAN'T DO THAT LIKE ON MIXER AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
# timed messages need to be independent of listening for messages AND not hold up the entire program aaaaaaAAAAAAAA
# quote db because i'm tired of scorpbot
# maybe the bot shouldn't run NoPing when someone else is running a command (like quotes)
# actually the incoming message handing in general is... y i k e s
# "oh boy 3 am" command needs to ask for time zone on boot (default to system time zone)
